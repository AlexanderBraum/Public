# Project SimpleSqrsMediator
This project implements a lightweight CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) mediator middleware in C#. It provides abstractions and handlers for separating command and query responsibilities, making it easier to build scalable and maintainable applications.

**Features:**
- Mediator pattern for CQRS
- Command and Query handler interfaces
- Extensible middleware pipeline

**Getting Started:**
1. Reference the project in your solution.
2. Register command and query handlers.
3. Use the mediator to send commands and queries.
